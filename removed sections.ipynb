    "The Universal Healthcare coefficient predicts that a country's life expectancy will decrease by 0.03 years if the country has UHC. This coefficient is suprising because it would be expected that while UHC not only increases life expectancy by providing more care to its people, but also that countries with UHC tend to already be more developed. However, this coefficient is low and may be an artifact of the model and reminents of collinearity shifting weight towards another variate. \n"
