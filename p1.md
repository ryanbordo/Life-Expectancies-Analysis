# Brainstorming

## Explanation

Using UN and CDC data, there are many datasets available that are very reputable and precise. Use demographic data from the UN to fit models to demographics. These two websites have all sorts of data that have gone through rigorous vetting processes. We have gathered four datasets on covid, development, employment, and deaths to learn more about the relationships between these metrics to be predictive and better understand their connections.

## Questions

1. How can we decide what we could look for in these datasets?
2. Is there anything specifically we must have to meet requirements within our datasets?
3. Are there any limitations within these datasets that would restrict us in the project?
4. Do these datasets supply us with enough complexity?
5. Does a hypothesis for an association need to be original?

## TA Comments
Hi all, nice ideas!
1. One suggestion is that you can do some surface level data cleaning/exploration to see if there are any interesting questions you can answer from using a specific dataset. Usually datasets with a lot of columns are easier because there is a lot more features to work with and then you can narrow down.
2. There aren't any specific requirements for datasets, but you should make sure you can answer the data description part under the project in the course handbook.
3. Usually datasets with small number of rows aren't the best, but I see the tables linked do look very extensive.
4. The datasets do look like there is a lot of metrics and features to work with, so it depends on how complex the questions you want to evaluate are. You can always add on supplement datasets as you go.
5. Not completely sure by what you meet by original? If you mean by not the exact same as something done before, then yes.
