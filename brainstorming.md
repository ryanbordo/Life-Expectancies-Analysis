Using UN and CDC data, there are many datasets available that are very reputable and precise. Use demographic data from the UN to fit models to demographics. These two websites have all sorts of data that have gone through rigorous vetting processes. We have gathered four datasets on covid, development, employment, and deaths to learn more about the relationships between these metrics to be predictive and better understand their connections.
